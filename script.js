// 1. Make a loop that counts from 0 to 10.  It should print out "The number is" and each integer, from 0 to 10, in the console.


// 2. Make a loop that counts from 5 to 15 in the console, in multiples of 3. It should print out the number "is a multiple of 3."


// 3. Make a loop that counts backwards from 100 to 0, and prints out in the console.
console.log('Count down from 100:')



// 4. Make a loop that counts backwards from 100 to 0 in increments of 5, and prints out in the console.
console.log('Count down from 100:')


// 5. Write a function that takes in two integers parameters and returns the multiplication of those two values. Print the value to the console.


// 6. Write a function that takes in a string parameter and returns true if the string contains 'a', otherwise the function returns false.


// 7. Write a function that takes in a number and prints the multiplication table of that number(multiply the number by 0 - 10).

//Done!
